An (unofficial) dedicated server implementation for [Beatblock](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3045200/Beatblock/) for hosting multiplayer lobbies!   
The client has not yet been implemented, and the server implementation is incomplete. Come back later!

Made with [Netty](https://netty.io/) and [Paklet](https://github.com/MachineMC/Paklet)
